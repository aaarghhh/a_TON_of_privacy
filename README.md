## FLAGS 
- The flag `-c` supports pivots and in depth analysis, ATM it helps to correlate TON domains to ENS domains, simply pivoting on the second-level domain.
```
[+]  Details for domain ENS domain: xxxxxx.eth
  ├  Owner address:  0xd8xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ├  Registration:  2020-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ├  Expiry:  2034-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  └  ------------------------------------
```
- The flag `-t` enable a TOR SOCK5 proxy for each connection.

- The flag `-s` is silent so it doesn't print any result on stdout. 

- The flag `-p` will enable the pivot from TON NFT to TELEGRAM account, this is a new feature that requires a fine tune in order to avoid bad OPSEC mistake. **PLEASE READ THE NEXT CHAPTER CAREFULLY**

- The flag `-l` it's a flag that let to create a session string. The session string is a string that could be used to authenticate to Telegram avoiding the use of SQLLITE, this string could be used in .env file in order to investigate on +888 TON numbers.

- The parameter `--picpath`, if `-p` enabled, can contain a path where Telegram profile pics will be stored. Each file will be renamed as Telegram_id[.]extension.

## TELEGRAM PIVOTING 

For using this new feature you need to be sure that you properly **‼️ setup a clean dedicated sock puppet ‼️**.  
You can follow different guide on how to create them with a disposable number.
The sockpuppet need to be hardened as much is possible.

### UNDER PRIVACY SETTINGS ON YOUR TELEGRAM CLIENT
```
Phone number -> Nobody
Last Seen / Online -> Nobody 
Profile Pics -> Nobody
Bio -> Nobody
Forwarded Message -> Nobody
Calls -> Nobody
Group & Channel -> Nobody
```

After the sock puppet creation, You'll need API HASH and API KEY. 
Telegram 'API_ID' and 'API_HASH', which you can get by creating a developers account using this link: https://my.telegram.org/.  
Place these values in a .env file in the directory where you launch or set environment variable for the session, along with the phone number of your Telegram account:

```
API_ID=123456
API_HASH=aaaaaaaavvvvvvbbbbbbbbb1223
PHONE_NUMBER=+11234XXXXXX
SESSION_STRING=aabababababbababab123123...
```
If your Telegram account was properly created and your file .env was installed in the directory where you launch the tool, a new SQLlite containing your Telegram session information will be created. If you'll use SESSION_STRING, the SQLlite file will be ignored and the authentication phase will skipped.
